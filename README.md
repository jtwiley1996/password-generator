# password-generator

## Objective
In this assignment, I was tasked with completing the javascript for an already completed website. When
you click a button, it will now let you select everything you'd like for a random password. The HTML and CSS
were already completed, but for the JS, I had to define my variables, create the appropiate if statements and loops,
and then create an event that would display the results on the screen.

## Code

The code for the HTML and CSS were taken from the assignment layout, as well as minor starter code from CSS.
For some of the code I used in my Javascript (Math.random, prompt, and confirm), I found those through a resources called 
W3Schools.
